# 283. Move Zeroes

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you minimize the total number of operations done?

# Result:

Runtime: 164 ms, faster than 17.51% of Python3 online submissions for Move Zeroes.
Memory Usage: 15.4 MB, less than 21.49% of Python3 online submissions for Move Zeroes.

# Solution:

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

The code is self-explanatory.
